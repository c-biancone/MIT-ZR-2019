# MIT-ZR-2019
Alliance "Pizza&amp;Bacon" code from the 2019 MIT Zero Robotics World Championships. It was written by teams Kühlschrank from Andover, NJ, BACON from Charlottesville, VA, and ZRighi from Napoli, Italy, and honed through both 2D and 3D simulations prior to the competition.

Our alliance tied for second and eventually placed third after the tie-breaker.

This code was run live on the International Space Station on the SPHERES Satellites by Cosmonaut Oleg Dmitrievich Kononenko and Astronaut Anne C. McClain.

Purpose:
This code controls one SPHERES satellite to navigate across a space within the ISS, hook onto another moving 'disabled' SPHERES satellite, and tow it back to the other side of the field. The SPHERES are moved by carefully controlling the spray of carbon dioxide released from jets on the outside of the satellite.
